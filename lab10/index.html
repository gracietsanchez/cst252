        <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p> The goal of this lab was to use the sort function from Lab 7 and attach an
            event listner. This listner will get the value of the input field, run the value
            through the function and save the results.  </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
          <p> In this lab we both were succsessfully able to use an event listner to execute
            the function we each chose. I heaily relied on the notes from class lecture, Gabby's
            inpput and Wes's example site by using the inspect tool. I used Wes's site the mostly
            because I could reference my code and be able to pintpoint the source of the problem
            that I was having.   </p>
