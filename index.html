		<h1> All About Me! </h1>

		<p> Hey everyone! My name is Gracie Sanchez and I am a Communication Design major here at CSUMB.
			I am a Visual Design concentration but I am also pursuing a minor in Buissness Administration.
			I am from Madera California which is just outside of Fresno. I have danced my entire life in various
			styles including ballet, contemporary, charcter, pointe, jazz, hip hop and most recently, latin ballroom.
			I also like playing tennis and going to the gym to work out. With my degree I hope that I can be successful
			at creating graphics and fuctioning websites with new marketing tactics for both struggling
			and established buissnesses.
