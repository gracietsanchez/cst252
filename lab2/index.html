		<h1> Welcome To My Webpage! </h1>

		<p> My partner for this lab is Amanda Auld. We are both second year students with a visual design emphasis. Oddly enough Amanda and I are both from Fresno California. We both enjoy playing tennis with each other. Amanda has been a great partner for these labs because she is able to help me without babying me too much. This has already helped me feel a tad more confident in HTML and CSS.
