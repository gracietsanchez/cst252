        <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>In this lab we were asked to experiment even more with the Javascript. We learned how to construct
          various objects and manipulate them to say different attributes about our modes of transportation. </p>
      </div>


      <div id="problems" class="blue" class="green">
          <h2> Problems?</h2>
            <p> In this lab I did not encounter many issues. I only had a little difficulty remebering exactly how
              to push my site through to Github but I was able to recall this fairly quickly.</p>
      </div>


      <div id="results" class="blue" class="green">
        <h2>Results</h2>
          <p> In the final results you should be able to see that in my Output there is my different modes of transportation
          being described. This was all achieved by maniplulating the Javascript file. </p>
