        <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p> The task of this lab was to first create a new index.html for lab 9. Then we were to experiement
            modifying our CSS withing our Javascript. We did this by using getElementById to reference our
            variables and then change them.  </p>

      <section id="Problems">
          <h2> Problems?</h2>
            <p>This lab was challenging for me. I reviewed my notes and after lots of bug fixes and testing I
              think that I was able to succsessfully change some CSS through my Javascript File. I had issues
              refrencing it once again but I was able to sort it out after some debugging. </p>

      <section id="Results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
          <p> In this lab we were able to successfully code out way through using both the console and Atom.
            We were able to correctly refernce the correct files and display the CSS changes through our
            Javascript in our final index.html </p>
