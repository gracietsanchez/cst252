        <h2>Problems</h2>
          <p>In this lab I did not encounter many problems as I did last lab. I remebered the error
             that I made in Lab 6 and made sure to double check that I did not repeat that mistake again.
             With the help of the in class demonstration and my partner we were both able to successfully complete
             our labs.</p>
