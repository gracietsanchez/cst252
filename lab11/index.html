        <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p> In this lab we were tasked with learning and beginning to work with jQuery.
          After experiementing in class we were to manipulate the code in our javascript
          file and properly link both at the head of our htmnl documents.  </p>

      <section id="Problems">
          <h2> Problems?</h2>
            <p> In this lab we did not really encounter many problems. Experimenting in
              class and being called on a few times really helped get the idea in motion.
              I refered to Wes's website and my partner Gabby to complete the assignment.  </p>

      <section id="Results">
        <h2>Results</h2>
          <p> The final result of our efforts are displayed here. We created buttons that
            have an alert appear when the button was pressed. All of this was done
            using jQuery. </p>
