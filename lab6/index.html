					<h2>Challenge</h2>
						<p> In this lab we were tasked with defining variables in the console of our Google Chrome browser. We worked off of our Lab 5 Javascript when we define our
							method of transportation. Now we are using those defined variables to create strings and arrays. From there we were able to put this text into our
						Lab 6 index.html file.  </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p>In this lab I didn't encounter too many problems. The biggest issue that I faced wascopying the lab too closely and Gabby and I finding an error in the
						in console Javascript. After asking in class we were able to quickly resolve it and understand the mistake. </p>
