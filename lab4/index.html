//Take 2 boxes of strawberry cake mix
//Pour contents of both boxes into mixing bowl
//Combine ½ cup of water, 4 eggs, and ⅔ cup of vegetable oil into mixing bowl
//Combine ingredients in bowl until combined evenly
//Be careful to not overmix batter to a thick consistency
//Prepare brownie pan\
//Spray an 11x13 inch square baking pan with nonstick butter cooking spray
//Pour batter evenly into baking pan
//Check oven to see if preheat setting has completed
//If so, place pan in the middle rack in the center of the oven
//Bake
//Close oven door and set timer for 15 minutes
//After 15 minutes, carefully place a toothpick in the center of the baking pan touching the bottom of the pan.
//If the toothpick has no residue, you may take the brownies out.
//If the toothpick does have residue, place it in the oven for an additional 7 minutes and continue checking until the toothpick has no residue upon removal.
//Enjoy
//Let brownie cool on a wire rack covered with a towel for 20-30 minutes before cutting and serving

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
						<p>This lab was meant to show us how to develop the process of pseudocoding a
							simple task and then translating the same process to a computer task. .</p>
				</section>
				<section id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
						<p>We ran into the small problem of figuring out what kind of computer
							task we wanted to pseudocode. It was difficult selecting a game,
							task, or automation without knowing how such tasks should be broken
							down when programming. However, after some research and contemplation,
							we selected a simple computer task that we felt comfortable dividing
							into high-level tasks.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="results">
					<h2>Results</h2>
						<p>We successfully outlined and pseudocoded an everyday task as well
							as a computer task. The pseudocode for the everyday task describes
							the process behind making strawberry brownies, and the pseudocode for the
							computer task describes a program asking for the user's name in order to
							create a personalized greeting. We turned both outlines into comments
							in our lab.js folder and included them in our lab4/index.html as well.
							Finally, we published our lab4 pages to the server.</p>
