	<h1> Lab 3 File Structures</h1>

	<p> The main goal of this lab was to be able to create a local file structure. In the structure would be our local index.html,
		 JS, img and CSS files. I did not struggle with this portion of the lab because of my prior knowldge of the file structures from CST 251.</p>

	<h2> Challenges</h2>

	<p> The creation of the file structure wasn't that difficult for me. My only difficulty was messing with the CSS to achieve the look that I wanted.</p>

	<h2> Results</h2>

	<p> Displayed on my page you should be able to see that the file structure was properly set up in order to be displaying everything that you are seeing right now. </p>
